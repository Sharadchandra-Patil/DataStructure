what is wrong about singly linked list?
Answers
1. Singly linked list is a collection of nodes linked together in a sequential way 
   where each node of singly linked list contains a data field
2. singly list is an address field which contains the reference of the next node.
3. Singly linked list can contain multiple data fields but 
   should contain at least single address field pointing to its connected next node.
4. None Of Above   //<-- Ans

2. 
What would be the asymptotic time complexity to add a node at the end of singly linked list, 
if the pointer is initially pointing to the head of the list?
Answers
1. O(1)
2. O(n)
3. θ(n)   //<-- Ans
4. Θ(1)


3.
which statement is True about circular linked list?
Answers
1. Entire list can be traversed from any node.
2. Circular lists are the required data structure when 
   we want a list to be accessed in a circle or loop.
3. Despite of being singly circular linked list we can easily traverse to its previous node, 
   which is not possible in singly linked list.
4. All of Above  //<-- Ans

 What is the worst case time complexity of inserting a node in a doubly linked list?
Answers
1. O(nlogn)
2. O(logn)
3. O(n)     //<-- Ans
4. O(1)


5. 
Which of the following is false about a doubly linked list?
Answers
1. We can navigate in both the directions
2. It requires more space than a singly linked list
3. The insertion and deletion of a node take a bit longer                check?
4. Implementing a doubly linked list is easier than singly linked list   //<-- Ans


6. 
Which of the following operations is performed more efficiently by doubly linked list than
by singly linked list?
Answers
1. Deleting a node whose location in given             //<-- Ans   check?
2. Searching of an unsorted list for a given item
3. Inverting a node after the node with given location
4. Traversing a list to process each node

Answers
1. Array
2. Structure
3. LinkedList             //<-- Ans
4. Union

What would be the asymptotic time complexity to add a node at the end of a singly linear linked list, 
if the pointer is initially pointing to the head of the list and another pointer pointing to the tail node?
Answers
1. O(1)
2. O(n)         //<-- Ans
3. θ (n)   ?what to consider when asympotic time complexity asked (worst or average)  Q.2 and Q.8
4. θ (1)

3. Three pointer   //<-- Ans
4. None



10. Below one is add_first() functionality code for empty Doubly CircularLinked list. Find the correct statement to replace ????
	head = newnode;
	tail = newnode;
	tail ->next = head;
	????
Answers
1. tail->next->next = tail
2. head->prev = tail;              //<-- Ans
3. tail->prev = head;
4. head->prev = NULL;
